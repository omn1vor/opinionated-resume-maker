# If you have a lot of relevant experience - you can write whatever you want in any part of the resume.
# In any case, do not delve deeper than 10 years into your experience.
# The first entry should be the most recent, be it working experience or education or whatnot.

      1C:Enterprise is a Russian framework for creating business applications with its own VB-like language.
      In addition to the development I also participated in meetings with clients and supervised work of other

summary: >-
  Switching to Java at the moment. I have studied Java for the last 7 months and think that, given my 
  experience in software development in general, I'll be a team asset pretty soon if given a chance. 
  I'm passionate about coding and music.
